# Blur-It 

<H2>Blur-It is an Android project demonstrating an efficient method for background blurring, particularly challenging on Android 11 or earlier devices. 
<br>The project includes a movable blur view that traverses the constraint layout </b>, along with a seek bar to dynamically adjust the blur radius. Additionally, 
  it addresses and seeks to ignore any UI glitches for a smoother user experience. 🙏🏻 </H2>

<H1>Here is the sample Images</H1>
